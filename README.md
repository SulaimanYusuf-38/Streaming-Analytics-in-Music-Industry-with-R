# 🎶 Streaming Music Data Analysis – R Visualisation Project

This project explores streaming music data using R to identify trends in song characteristics and listener preferences. The analysis focuses on the top 50 most-streamed songs and aims to uncover meaningful insights through data visualisation techniques.

## 📌 Objective

To use R and its data visualisation libraries to analyse musical features from streaming platforms, helping stakeholders in the music industry better understand listener preferences and track characteristics.

## 🎧 Dataset Overview

- **Data Source**: Simulated dataset of Top 50 streamed songs  
- **Key Features**:
  - `energy`, `valence`, `acousticness`, `danceability`
  - `popularity`, `duration`, `release year`
  - `artist_name`, `track_name`, `genre`

## 📊 Visualisations Created

1. **Energy vs Valence by Genre**  
   - Scatterplot showing emotional intensity of songs  
   - Genres such as pop and EDM cluster in high-energy, high-valence areas

2. **Acousticness vs Popularity**  
   - Inverse trend observed: higher acousticness tends to have lower popularity

3. **Danceability Distribution**  
   - Pop and reggaeton genres dominate high danceability scores

4. **Artist Frequency in Top Charts**  
   - Bar chart of artists with multiple top tracks

5. **Release Year Trend**  
   - Line chart showing rise of recent tracks in streaming charts

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries

- **R Programming Language**
- **ggplot2** – for advanced plotting
- **dplyr** – for data manipulation
- **tidyverse** – for unified data workflow

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Pop and Latin genres** dominate top charts due to their high energy and danceability
- **Streaming trends** favour newly released tracks (post-2020)
- Songs with **lower acousticness and higher energy** are more likely to be popular
- Artists like **Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa, and The Weeknd** appear frequently across genres
